# Simple-Java-Chatbot
![Banner]

This is code from a project I've worked on through the JetBrains Academy.

Project Title: Creating a Simple Chat Bot in Java

The functions I have implemented include -

-Greet

 -The bot greets the user and tells about itself.
 
 -Then askes the user for their name.
 
-RemindName

 -Takes a string input for the name and prints it out for confirmation from the user.
 
-GuessAge

 -The bot guesses the users age by asking them to divide their age by certain numbers (3, 5 and 7).
 
 -It calculates the age using a theorem (Column Chinese remainder theorem) based on the input given by the user in the previous step.
 
-Count

 -Asks the user to enter a number
 
 -A loop starts which prints out all the numbers starting from 0 till the input value is reached
 
-Test

 -A multiple-choice question is presented to the user.
 
 -The user needs to choose the appropriate answer.
 
 -If the wrong answer is entered, a message is printed out that asks the user to enter a choice again.
 
 -If the choice is correct, the while loop is exited.
